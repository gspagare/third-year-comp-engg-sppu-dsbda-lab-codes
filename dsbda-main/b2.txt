To design a distributed application using MapReduce that processes a log file of a system, you can follow these steps:

Input Data: Obtain the log file of the system that you want to process. The log file can be in any text-based format, such as CSV, TSV, or plain text.

Mapper Function: Write a mapper function that takes each line of the log file as input and performs the required processing. The mapper function should extract relevant information from the log entries and emit key-value pairs based on the processing logic. The key could be a specific attribute or category, and the value can be any relevant data associated with that key.

Reducer Function: Write a reducer function that receives the key-value pairs emitted by the mapper function. The reducer function performs aggregation or further processing on the received data. It combines values with the same key and generates the final output based on the desired analysis or computation.

MapReduce Job Configuration: Configure the MapReduce job by setting the input and output paths, specifying the mapper and reducer classes, and setting any other job-specific parameters. You can use the Hadoop API or any other MapReduce framework of your choice to define and configure the job.

Job Execution: Submit the MapReduce job for execution. The MapReduce framework will distribute the input data across multiple nodes in the cluster, assign mapper tasks to process the data in parallel, perform shuffle and sort operations, and finally, execute the reducer tasks to produce the output.

Output: The output of the MapReduce job can be stored in a distributed file system, such as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), or any other suitable storage medium. It can be in any format that suits your analysis requirements, such as a text file, CSV, or a database.

Post-processing and Analysis: Once the MapReduce job completes and the output is available, you can perform additional post-processing or analysis on the output data, depending on your specific use case. This can include generating reports, visualizing the results, e
