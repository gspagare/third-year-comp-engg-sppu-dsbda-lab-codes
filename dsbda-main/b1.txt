Hadoop: Hadoop is an open-source framework designed for distributed storage and processing of large-scale data sets. It provides a distributed file system called Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and a computational paradigm known as MapReduce.

MapReduce: MapReduce is a programming model and computational paradigm for processing and generating large-scale data sets in a parallel and distributed manner. It consists of two main stages: the Map stage and the Reduce stage. The Map stage processes the input data and produces intermediate key-value pairs, and the Reduce stage aggregates and summarizes the intermediate results to produce the final output.

Mapper: In the WordCount application, the TokenizerMapper class is the implementation of the Mapper interface. The mapper takes the input data and processes it to generate intermediate key-value pairs. In this case, the mapper tokenizes the input text and emits key-value pairs where the word is the key and the value is always 1.

Reducer: In the WordCount application, the IntSumReducer class is the implementation of the Reducer interface. The reducer takes the intermediate key-value pairs produced by the mapper and performs the final aggregation. In this case, the reducer sums up the values for each key, which gives us the count of occurrences of each word.

Input and Output Formats: Hadoop supports various input and output formats. In the WordCount application, the input format is a text file, and the output format is also a text file. Hadoop provides classes such as TextInputFormat and TextOutputFormat to handle these formats.

Job Configuration: The Configuration class in Hadoop is used to configure the Hadoop job. It allows setting various properties such as the input and output paths, mapper and reducer classes, input and output formats, and other job-specific parameters.

Job Execution: The Job class in Hadoop represents a MapReduce job. It is responsible for submitting the job to the Hadoop cluster, managing the execution, and monitoring the job's progress and status.
