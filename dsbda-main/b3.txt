To locate a weather dataset for your analysis, you can try the following approaches:

Government Weather Agencies: Government weather agencies often provide historical weather data for research and analysis purposes. For example, you can check websites such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the United States or the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in Europe. These agencies often provide access to historical weather datasets through their data portals or APIs.

Open Data Platforms: Explore open data platforms that provide various datasets, including weather data. Platforms such as data.gov, Kaggle, or Google Dataset Search can be valuable resources for finding publicly available weather datasets. You can search for specific keywords related to weather data and filter the results based on your requirements.

Academic and Research Institutions: Many academic and research institutions maintain weather data repositories for scientific research purposes. Check the websites of universities or research institutions that focus on climate science, meteorology, or related fields. They may provide access to weather datasets or point you in the right direction.

Commercial Weather Data Providers: Some companies specialize in providing comprehensive weather data services. While these services often come at a cost, they offer extensive weather data with detailed attributes. Examples of such providers include IBM's The Weather Company, AccuWeather, or Weather Underground. These providers offer APIs or subscription-based access to their datasets.

Once you find a suitable weather dataset, you can download the dataset in a format that you can work with, such as CSV or JSON. You can then process the dataset using the programming language and tools of your choice to calculate the average values for temperature, dew point, and wind speed.
